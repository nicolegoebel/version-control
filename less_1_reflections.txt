I think version control is important for saving previous versions.
I also find version control confusing at times.
I would like to learn GitHub well.

Having easy access to entire history of a file will make me a more efficient programmer. 
No more clicking around.
I will be able to make notes about why one version is different from another.

Pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit versus autosave.
- differences in versions are meaningful and eaier to track

Why do some VC systems like Git allow saving multiple files in one commit (whereas others like Google docs treats each file separately):  because the files are often dependent on one another.

UYinsg git log and git diff to view history of files:  use git log to get the keys for each commit of interest and git diff key1 key2 to view their diffrences!
-  this allows you to learn what changes have been made in the files.

How might using VC make you more confident to make changes that could break something?  You would not hesitate to continue making changes since you can always go back to the original! Allows you to go exploring!!

What do you want to try using Git for?
