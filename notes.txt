REFLECTIONS
I will be able to make notes about why one version is different from another.
 
Pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit versus autosave.
 - differences in versions are meaningful and eaier to track
 
Why do some VC systems like Git allow saving multiple files in one commit       (whereas others like Google docs treats each file separately):  because the     files are often dependent on one another.
 
Using git log and git diff to view history of files:  use git log to get the   keys for each commit of interest and git diff key1 key2 to view their           diffrences!
 -  this allows you to learn what changes have been made in the files.
 
 How might using VC make you more confident to make changes that could break     something?  You would not hesitate to continue making changes since you can     always go back to the original! Allows you to go exploring!!
 
What do you want to try using Git for?
